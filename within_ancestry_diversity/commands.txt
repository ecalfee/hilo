# This analysis looks at within-ancestry diversity to assess
# (1) is there evidence of bottlenecks or sweeps for outlier introgressed regions
# This analysis compares pi within introgressed segments to pi within local and allopatric populations for the same regions
# (2) what is the likely source population for adaptive introgression and is it the same across populations?
# This analysis uses Fst calculations between introgressed segments and potential donor populations that are sympatric or allopatric

# Step 1: use R and bedtools to identify regions with homozygous ancestry for each individual:
# ID.2mex.bed and ID.2maize.bed

# Step 2: use bedtools to filter bam files to only include regions homozygous for ancestry

# Step 3: use ANGSD to calculate allele frequencies for each population (SAF)
# and for each pair of populations (2DSFS) for segments that are maize homozygous,
# and separately for segments that are mexicana homozygous

# Step 4: use the results from step 3 to calculate pi-within and Fst between
# all pairs of populations across the genome

# Step 5: Summarize statistics to characterize genomewide patterns but also 
# large outlier regions individually
