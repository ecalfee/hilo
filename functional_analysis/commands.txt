# this is a functional analysis of outliers:
(I) Are domestication genes 'special' in terms of resistance to introgression?
(II) What does ancestry look like at specific known barrier-genes?
(III) Do we find evidence of elevation-associated mexicana introgression for genes associated with flowering time?


(I) Domestication genes
Dan is re-doing the domestication scan with Li's maize landraces, looking for sweeps in maize
For now I can use the cross-pop LD-based domestication candidates from Hufford 2012
data/domestication/gene_model_translation_to_APGv4_Zm00001d.2_hits.txt #only about half could be found in v4 gene set

(II) Barrier gene candidates
Putative Ga2 loci male and female (right next to each other)
GRMZM2G410783, AC231426.1_FG002
5.30.19 Jeff gave me gene candidates for the incompatibility loci Ga2 (male and female).
I used maizeGDB to look up the positions of those candidate genes and got positions for v1, v2, and v3 (5b+) reference genomes.
https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene
The gene annotation for reference genome v4 is comparatively poor and doesn't have these genes annotated but I can either
(1) match by sequence
(2) liftover from v3 to v4 coordinates - did this using http://ensembl.gramene.org/Zea_mays/Tools/AssemblyConverter
The v4 coordinates are saved as GRMZM2G410783_v4_coord.bed (female Ga2) and AC231426.1_FG002_v4_coord.bed (male Ga2)


(III) Flowering time pathway and GWAS hits
# All flowering time genes are written for v3 gene sets:
(a) Li Wang's candidate genes. PBE = Population Branch Excess. MH = mexico highland PBE outlier, US is US Southwest, GH is Guatemala HIghland, AN is Andean 
(b) Dong 2012 pathway analysis using QTL/functional studies and componenets of Arabidopsis pathway (n=48)
data/flowering_time/floweringTimeMaizeDong2012.csv
(c) Navarro 2017. F1 association mapping study 'FOAM GWAS' using landraces across the Americas. 
(d) I could alternatively use a set of 220 flowering time candidates from Yong-xiang Li 2016 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.13174 from NAM US + NAM CHINA + natural pop AMES (all RILs; ~8.7k total; GWAS). But I think Navarro 2017 is better because it includes variation from the highlands specifically vs. NAMs


# I downloaded the full set of conversions between v3 and all other gene sets (including v4)
# then I removed extra lines
