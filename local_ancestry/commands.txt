a# local ancestry calling

0) Before starting:
Call variant sites (variant_sites/)
Get genomewide ancestry prior for each pop from NGSAdmix (global_ancestry/)
Calculate allele frequencies & # included individuals for allopatric maize and mex (within_ancestry_diversity/)

1) Filter SNPs for 'informative' sites with > .3 alelle freq diff between allopatric maize and mexicana and minimum 10 individuals with data from each group
local_ancestry$ sbatch --export=PREFIX=pass2_alloMAIZE,D=0.3,MIN_MAIZE=10,MIN_MEX=10 filterAlloMAFnInd.sh
Submitted batch job 10490296 - redoing:
Submitted batch job 10490726 - RUNNING

2) Reduce LD by filter SNPs to minimum >.001 cM spacing
local_ancestry$ sbatch --dependency=afterok:10490726 pruneFixedcM_HMM.sh
Submitted batch job 10491135 - DIDN;T WORK - FORGOT PREFIX 4.26.19:
local_ancestry$ sbatch --export=PREFIX=pass2_alloMAIZE pruneFixedcM_HMM.sh

3) Get allele and read counts

4) Make input files; including global ancestry per pop including individuals >.1x coverage

5) Run ancestry_mm for each population. Set priors for non admixed populations very low, e.g. .001 admixture

6) Test robustness by filtering counts down to a lower different x coverage
