# local ancestry calling

0) Before starting:
Call variant sites (variant_sites/)
Get genomewide ancestry prior for each pop from NGSAdmix (global_ancestry/) 
Calculate allele frequencies & # included individuals for allopatric maize and mex (within_ancestry_diversity/)

1) Filter SNPs for 'informative' sites with > .3 alelle freq diff between allopatric maize and mexicana and minimum 10 individuals with data from each group
local_ancestry$ sbatch --export=PREFIX=pass2_alloMAIZE,D=0.3,MIN_MAIZE=10,MIN_MEX=10 filterAlloMAFnInd.sh
Submitted batch job ***

2) Reduce LD by filter SNPs to minimum >.001 cM spacing
local_ancestry$ sbatch --dependency=afterok:*** pruneFixedcM.sh
