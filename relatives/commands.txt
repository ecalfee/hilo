# identifying close relatives in the dataset
# first I confirm that the same samples, sequenced on different lanes, are identified as the same sample by kinship
# there are 74 such duplicates, mostly in allopatric maize thus far.

# I used R calc_ibs.R to evaluate whether resequenced samples look IBS across the genome -- in general yes, close to 98.8% sequence identity compared to other random pairs with mean 96.2% identity by state. Other pairs with low # overlapping sites with reads also can have by chance 100% IBS. HILO80 is the only one with nontrivial shared coverage that looks like it may not be a true match -- this sample is already being excluded due to a lab note for likely contamination; it could be a mix of multiple samples.

# angsd website has r code to interpret IBS from the output files:

# alternatively, and perhaps better, I can use NGSrelate if I plug in population allele frequencies
