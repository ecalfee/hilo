# Genotypes from mexican landrace maize populations, sequenced to high depth
# these would be an alternative to the 282 maize dataset as a maize reference panel
# advantage is that they are more locally sourced and evenly sampled across 5 pops
# but disadvantage is that they are not necessarily admixture free

# copied data over from farm server
# invariant sites (in case these don't match the reference maize pop)
# I did not copy these over, but it could be done (152G)

# I started, but aborted copying scp these files (quite large)
# If I need them I can summarize on farm and then copy over

# notes on filtering from Anne lorant <anne.lorant1@gmail.com> :
#Hi Erin,

#the LR VCF is ready, you can find the file in /group/jrigrp6/RILAB_data/LR_filt/no_indel/LR.allpop.variants.filtered.final.vcf
#This file contains 5 populations 10 individuals per populations (in order the 10 first individuals are from the same pop, ...)
#I filtered the file or SNP calling quality (which is MQ, BQ, position on the read,...)
#I removed the indels and kept only biallelic SNPs
#I filtered on single individual for min depth of 10 and max depth of 60
#I kept only sites with at least 80% of data over all the populations,
#I filtered for HWE (p0.1) for each population separately and removed these sites on all the populations together.
