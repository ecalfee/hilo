This paper used a comparison of XP-CLR cross-population composite likelihood ratio statistic (Chen 2010) 
to identify regions of the genome with elevated divergence between parviglumis and maize landraces
extending over large regions, consistent with fast rises in frequency (ie selection) during domestication
Candidate genes were identified within these elevated regions. One concern is that adaptive introgression
or even neutral introgression, from mexicana might also create elevated XP-CLR (not sure).
