starch metabolism pathway - candidate gene approach to test for selection: 6 key genes were the focus of Whitt 2002
amylose extender1 (ae1), brittle2 (bt2), shrunken1 (sh1), shrunken2 (sh2), sugary1 (su1), and waxy1 (wx1): found lower pi in su1, bt2 and ae1, additional HKA significant results indicate selection at su1 and bt2, with possible ongoing/segregating selection at ae1
